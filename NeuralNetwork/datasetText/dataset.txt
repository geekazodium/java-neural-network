What is the language of art?
The language of art is the expression of an artist’s style through their works. There are plenty of different ways for an artist to express themselves, and the different ways that they achieve it are, in essence, the language of art.(https://www.tate.org.uk/artist-rooms/language)

Is the artist’s intention relevant to the viewer?
Yes, it is, the intention of the artist is very relevant. Art is subjective and so is one’s interpretation of art, meaning it’s difficult to pin down exactly what an art piece is trying to convey without knowing any context. To summarize, art is a language, and just like when you speak to someone in any language, context (or in this case, the artist’s intentions) matter.
